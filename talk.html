<h2>Parts of a Violin</h2>
<p>The violin consists of 9 main parts: The body, neck/fingerboard, tuning pegs, scroll, f holes, bridge, tailpiece, chin rest, and strings. These parts all combine together to allow the violin to create the beautiful sound that it makes. For example, the bridge and the f holes allow the sound to travel into the body and allow it to resonate within the body, creating the rich unique tones each violin has. The harmony between these pieces are endless, as they all affect each other, one way or another.</p>

<h2>How to play a Violin</h2>
<p>To start off, lets learn how to hold a violin. First, put your chin on the chinrest, as shown in the picture below. If you do this right and hold the violin with your chin tight enough, you should be able to support the whole thing with just your chin. After practicing this, put your left hand at the neck of the violin, and hold the violin as shown below. Now you know how to hold the violin.</p>

<p>Let's hold off on the bow for now. To begin to make a sound, just use your right pointer finger, grip the third string from left to right, and grip it with the tip of your pointer finger. Once you are ready, create a plucking motion with your pointer finger. You just created music! After this, try the other strings, with the same technique. Once you feel comfortable with this motion with your right hand, move on to using the fingers on your left hand, and pressing each one down on the fingerboard. If you did this right, you should hear different notes. Congratulations! You now know a fundemental part of creating sound on a violin! Though you might sound really really bad at first, practice makes perfect, so just keep trying at it!</p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks to playing a Violin</h2>
<p>One really important tip is to relax when playing the violin. When you are tense, people can hear that through the sound you create. If you are relaxed and in control, you will make the best music you can make. Secondly, especially for complete beginners, make sure you are pressing down on the fingerboard hard enough. If you don't press down hard enough, the sound would be weak and sound disoriented. The most important tip is to always enjoy playing over mindlessly practicing. This could even apply for life in general!</p>
